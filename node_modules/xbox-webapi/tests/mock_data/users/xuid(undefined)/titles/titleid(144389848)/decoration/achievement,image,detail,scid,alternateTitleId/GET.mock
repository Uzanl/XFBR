Rain devastation on the battlefield and clear hordes of enemies in the blink of an eye. Those who stand with you will know the true power of the Light.\r\n• Agile and daring, Hunters are quick on their feet and quicker on the draw. Fan the hammer of your golden gun, flow through enemies like the wind, or strike from the darkness. Find the enemy, take aim, and end the fight before it starts.\r\n\r\nCOOPERATIVE AND COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER\r\nPlay with or against your friends and other Guardians in various PvE and PvP game modes.\r\n• Exciting co-op adventures teeming await with rare and powerful rewards.

You decide where your legend begins.\r\n• Face off against other players in fast-paced free-for-all skirmishes, team arenas, and PvE/PvP hybrid competitions. Mark special competitions like Iron Banner on your calendar and collect limited-time rewards before they're gone. Then, when you're ready, enter Trials of Osiris, where the only thing between you and glory are the best players in the world.\r\n\r\nEXOTIC WEAPONS AND ARMOR\r\nThousands of weapons, millions of options. Discover new gear combinations and define your own personal style. The hunt for the perfect arsenal begins.\r\n\r\n105 GB hard drive storage space required as of October 1, 2019. Subject to change.
